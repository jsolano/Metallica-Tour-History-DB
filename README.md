# Metallica Tour History Database

All data were taken from [**Kaggle - Metallica Tour History**](https://www.kaggle.com/kitsamho/metallica-tour-history). 



## Model and Database

I split the data into seven main parts:
- **Tour**
- **City** - **State** - **Country**
- **Album**
- **Song**
- **Acts**
- **Instrument**
- **Event URL**

and created this ER diagram.
